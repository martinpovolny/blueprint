* As a data scientist
 * I would like to get a CEPH bucket for my ML project.

Feature: CEPH buckets for data science users

Scenarion: User wants to store assets in a bucket
Given: User already has access to JupyterHub


Currently the steps are complicated as shown in https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues/48#issuecomment-768932522
Changes are needed to support this feature.
